# nasapower v4.0.3

This submission supersedes v4.0.2, which should not be released to CRAN due to issues in the tests.
This submission skips all tests requiring API connectivity on CRAN fixing this issue introduced with 4.0.2.
Sorry for the inconvenience, but I thought this was better to submit a new(er) version rather than causing failures on CRAN servers.
